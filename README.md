## Telegram WebRTC (VoIP) [![Mentioned in Awesome Telegram Calls](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/tgcalls/awesome-tgcalls)

This project consists of two main parts: [tgcalls](#tgcalls), [pytgcalls](#pytgcalls).
The first is a C++ Python extension.
The second uses the extension along with MTProto and provides high level SDK.
All together, it allows you to create userbots that can record and
broadcast in voice chats, make and receive private calls.

#### Pyrogram's snippet
```python
from pyrogram import Client, filters
from pyrogram.utils import MAX_CHANNEL_ID

from pytgcalls import GroupCallFactory

app = Client('pytgcalls')
group_call = GroupCallFactory(app).get_file_group_call('input.raw')


@group_call.on_network_status_changed
async def on_network_changed(context, is_connected):
    chat_id = MAX_CHANNEL_ID - context.full_chat.id
    if is_connected:
        await app.send_message(chat_id, 'Successfully joined!')
    else:
        await app.send_message(chat_id, 'Disconnected from voice chat..')


@app.on_message(filters.outgoing & filters.command('join'))
async def join_handler(_, message):
    await group_call.start(message.chat.id)


app.run()
```

#### Telethon's snippet
```python
from telethon import TelegramClient, events

from pytgcalls import GroupCallFactory

app = TelegramClient('pytgcalls', api_id, api_hash).start()
group_call_factory = GroupCallFactory(app, GroupCallFactory.MTPROTO_CLIENT_TYPE.TELETHON)
group_call = group_call_factory.get_file_group_call('input.raw')


@app.on(events.NewMessage(outgoing=True, pattern=r'^/join$'))
async def join_handler(event):
    chat = await event.get_chat()
    await group_call.start(chat.id)

app.run_until_disconnected()
```

### Features

- Python solution.
- Prebuilt wheels for macOS, Linux and Windows.
- Supporting popular MTProto libraries: Pyrogram, Telethon.
- Abstract class to implement own MTProto bridge.
- Work with voice chats in channels and chats.
- Multiply voice chats ([example](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/radio_as_smart_plugin.py)).
- System of custom handlers on events.
- Join as channels or chats.
- Join using invite (speaker) links.
- Speaking status with voice activity detection.
- Mute/unmute, pause/resume, stop/play, volume control and more...

### Available sources of input/output data transfers

- Raw (`GroupCallRaw`, [example with pyav](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/pyav.py),
[example of restreaming](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/restream_using_raw_data.py))
  — to send and receive data in `bytes` directly from Python.
- File (`GroupCallFile`, [playout example](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/file_playout.py),
  [recording example](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/recorder_as_smart_plugin.py))
  — to use audio files including named pipe (FIFO).
- Device (`GroupCallDevice`, [example](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/device_playout.py)) — 
to use system virtual devices. Please don't use it with real microphone, headphones, etc.

Note: All audio data is transmitted in PCM 16 bit, 48k. 
[Example how to convert files using FFmpeg](#audio-file-formats).

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- A [Telegram API key](https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/setup#api-keys).

### TODO list
- Incoming and Outgoing private calls 
(already there and working, but not in the release version).
- Group Video Calls
[and more...](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/issues)

### Installing

#### For Pyrogram
``` bash
pip3 install -U pytgcalls[pyrogram]
```

#### For Telethon
``` bash
pip3 install -U pytgcalls[telethon]
```

## tgcalls 

The first part of the project is C++ extensions for Python. [Pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
was used to write it. Binding occurs to the [tgcalls](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/tgcalls)
library by Telegram, which is used in all official clients. 
To implement the binding, the code of Telegram Desktop and Telegram Android was studied.
Changes have been made to the Telegram library. 
All modified code is [available as a subtree](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/tree/main/tgcalls/third_party/lib_tgcalls)
in this repository. The main ideas of the changes is to improve 
the sound quality and to add ability to work with third party audio device modules.
In addition, this binding implemented custom audio modules. These modules are allowing
transfer audio data directly from Python via bytes, transfer and control 
the playback/recording of a file or a virtual system device.

### How to build

Short answer for Linux:
```bash
git clone https://github.com//MarshalX/tgcalls.git --recursive
cd tgcalls
```
For x86_64:
```bash
docker-compose up tgcalls_x86_64
```
For AArch64 (ARM64):
```bash
docker-compose up tgcalls_aarch64
```

Python wheels will be available in `dist` folder in root of `tgcalls`.

More info:
- [Manylinux](build/manylinux/dev).
- [Ubuntu](build/ubuntu).
- [macOS](build/macos).
- [Windows](build/windows).

Also, you can investigate into [manylinux GitHub Actions builds](build/manylinux).

### Documentation

Temporarily, instead of documentation, you can use [an example](pytgcalls/pytgcalls)
along with MTProto.

## pytgcalls 

This project is implementation of using [tgcalls](#tgcalls) 
Python binding together with [MTProto](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto).
By default, this library are supports [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram)
and [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) clients for working 
with Telegram Mobile Protocol. 
You can write your own implementation of abstract class to work with other libraries.

### Learning by example

Visit [this page](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/tree/main/examples) to discover the official examples.

### Documentation

`pytgcalls`'s documentation lives at [tgcalls.org](https://tgcalls.org).

### Audio file formats

RAW files are now used. You will have to convert to this format yourself
using ffmpeg. The example how to transcode files from a code is available [here](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/e0b2d667728cc92cc0da437b9c85bcc909e4ac9c/examples/player_as_smart_plugin.py#L41).

From mp3 to raw (to play in voice chat):
```
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 48000 -acodec pcm_s16le input.raw
```

From raw to mp3 (files with recordings):
```
ffmpeg -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 48000 -acodec pcm_s16le -i output.raw clear_output.mp3
```

For playout live stream you can use this one:
```
ffmpeg -y -i http://stream2.cnmns.net/hope-mp3 -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 48000 -acodec pcm_s16le input.raw
```

For YouTube videos and live streams you can use youtube-dl:
```
ffmpeg -i "$(youtube-dl -x -g "https://youtu.be/xhXq9BNndhw")" -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 48000 -acodec pcm_s16le input.raw
```

And set input.raw as input filename.
